# Ollama x Streamlit Arena

This project demonstrates how to run and manage models locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) by creating an interactive UI with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

The app has a page for running chat-based models and also one for multimodal models (_llava and bakllava_) for vision-based use-cases.


## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Utilize Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Local Model Execution**: Run your Ollama models locally without the need for external APIs.
- **Real-time Responses**: Get real-time responses from your models directly in the UI.
